🎓 Python Grading System
📌 Overview

This project is a simple Python grading system that assigns grades (A, B, C, or D) based on marks scored by a student.

📝 Code
def grade(marks):
    if marks >= 90:
        print("A")
    elif marks >= 80:
        print("B")
    elif marks >= 70:
        print("C")
    else:
        print("D")

grade(78)

⚙️ How It Works

✅ 90 & above → 🏆 Grade A

✅ 80 – 89 → 🎉 Grade B

✅ 70 – 79 → 👍 Grade C

❌ Below 70 → 📉 Grade D

▶️ Example Execution
grade(78)


📤 Output:

C

💡 Notes

⚡ Indentation is important in Python → Always use consistent spaces/tabs.

🎯 Uses if-elif-else statements for checking ranges.

🐍 Works with Python 3.x.

✨ Happy Coding! 🚀
